in this project, I used bcrypt hashing algorithm mainly with 4 round. 

for more information about bcrypt hashing algorithm ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt

This project has not been completed. it is still being developing so I used this algorithm with 4 round. I am going to use more than 4 round like 12 round and Calculation will be more strong. 

after installing requried moduls, run this script.

`python passman.py`

by default, this web application will run on port 5000 so you can access this application with http://localhost:5000

Enjoy.
